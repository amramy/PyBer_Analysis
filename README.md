# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
Prepare a presentation for V.Isualize at PyBer by merging two sets of data to create a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data and focus on fares by city type. Then use this information to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

### Scope of Project: 
In this data we took a deep dive into the city type being Urban, Suburban, and Rural then we looked at how many rides there was and how that corresponded to the number of drivers. We then looked at the average fare people were paying for their commute on a weekly basis. 

### Results: 

Looking at the information we have gathered there was one-thousand more Urban rides than Suburban rides and one thousand five hundred more Urban rides than Rural rides. 

When looking at drivers compared to rides there was 780 more Urban drivers than there were rides where Suburban had 135 more rides than drivers and Rural had 47 more rides than drivers.

Urban Fares did bring in the most money with a total of $39,854.38 but also equated to the lowest average fare per ride at $24.53 and fare per driver was $16.57. 

Suburban did bring in $19,327.93 with an average ride fare of $30.97 equating to an average fare per driver at $39.50. 

Rural only brought in $4,327.93 with the highest average ride fare at $34.62 and an average fare per driver at $55.49

### Summary: 

While Urban cities had the most rides and had the most revenue, they also had far too many drivers per riders which is driving the average fare per driver down. 

Rural cities had an opposite issue where they bring in the least amount of money but have the highest average fare per driver because the average fare per ride is the highest amongst the three city types. If the average fare price was able to come down, there is potential to attract more riders from the community.

Suburban cities had less than half the riders but brought in a comparable amount of revenue to Urban cities. This would be a good target for number of drivers and average fare per ride.
